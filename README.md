# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (AI-NIDS)

## 📌 Project Overview
The AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (AI-NIDS) is a Machine Learning powered security application designed to detect malicious network traffic automatically.  
It classifies network packets into **Benign (Safe)** or **Malicious (Attack)** categories using a Random Forest algorithm.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity**.
